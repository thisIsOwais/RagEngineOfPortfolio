Hi, I’m Mohammadd Owais Ansari —2025 B.Tech Graduate from NIT Warangal. While my academic background is in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, my true passion lies in building tech that solves real-world problems.
I started my journey in software development during my first year, and since then, I’ve been consistently building — from full-stack applications to AI-powered tools. I’ve developed a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms using C++, and I’m comfortable working across the entire stack — particularly with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
Recently, I’ve been focusing on AI integration and backend scalability. I’ve explored tools like LangChain, LangGraph, Pinecone, and Weaviate, and I even built my own AI assistant that’s embedded in my portfolio. It supports real-time response streaming and uses OpenAI + vector search + text-to-speech (TTS) — making the portfolio interactive and dynamic.
In terms of experience, I’ve had the chance to work at:
Tripolymath – where I developed a serverless e-commerce platform using Node.js, PostgreSQL, and AWS Lambda, focusing on scalability and modular service design.
OSH – where I engineered a secure Aadhar-enabled backend using EKO API and JWT authentication, gaining hands-on experience with financial-grade system security.
Beyond internships, I’ve:
Led a monolith-to-microservices migration for a mock project, designing clear APIs and breaking down domain logic into scalable services.
Built a multi-tenant AI SaaS that streams real-time responses with proper RBAC, JWT auth, and S3-like cloud storage.
Designed system architectures with AWS, Docker, PostgreSQL, SQS, and event-driven designs.
I'm not just a coder — I’m someone who enjoys understanding systems holistically, whether it's improving performance, ensuring security, or enhancing user experience. I thrive in environments that encourage experimentation, ownership, and impact.
My goal is simple: to join a team where I can build meaningful, scalable solutions, learn from strong engineers, and contribute from day one.

Hi, I’m Mohd Owais Ansari — 2025 B.Tech Graduate from NIT Warangal. My academic background is in Metallurgy, but my real passion lies in technology and building impactful solutions that solve real-world problems.

My journey in tech began in my first year — I’ve been consistently building projects ever since. I’ve developed a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms using C++, and I specialize in full-stack development, particularly with the MERN stack. Recently, I’ve been exploring AI tools like LangChain, LangGraph, and vector databases — even building and integrating my own AI assistant into my portfolio to enhance interactivity.

I don't just think like a developer — I think like a product builder. I approach every project with a problem-solving mindset, focusing on the user experience, system design, and long-term scalability. I take complete ownership of what I build — from ideation to delivery — ensuring it’s efficient, secure, and valuable.

During my internship at Tripolymath, I helped design a serverless e-commerce backend using Node.js, PostgreSQL, and AWS Lambda. At OSH, I engineered a secure Aadhar-enabled payment system using EKO’s APIs and JWT-based authentication. These experiences taught me how to build robust, secure, production-ready systems that align with real-world constraints.

I’ve also led a monolith-to-microservices migration, architected cloud-first systems, and developed an AI SaaS assistant with real-time response streaming, combining OpenAI APIs, vector search, and text-to-speech.

I thrive in environments where I can build from the ground up, collaborate closely with cross-functional teams, and contribute to high-impact solutions. I'm not just looking to code — I aim to deliver meaningful products that scale, improve lives, and drive innovation.
