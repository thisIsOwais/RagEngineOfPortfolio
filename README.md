# GhostMe AI Assistant ü§ñ

## Overview

GhostMe AI Assistant is an innovative RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) based system that acts as an intelligent portfolio assistant. It combines advanced document retrieval with natural language generation to provide accurate, context-aware responses about professional experience and skills.

## üåü Key Features

- **Intelligent RAG System**: Combines document retrieval with language model generation
- **Real-time Streaming**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for instant responses
- **Voice Synthesis**: Azure Text-to-Speech integration for natural voice responses
- **Context-Aware**: Maintains conversation context and professional tone
- **Scalable Architecture**: Optimized for performance and extensibility

## üöÄ Technical Breakthroughs

### 1. Efficient Document Processing
- Implemented recursive character text splitting with 1000-character chunks
- 200-character overlap for maintaining context continuity
- Achieved balance between processing speed and context preservation

### 2. Vector Store Optimization
- Pinecone integration with concurrent operation support
- Optimized retrieval with k=3 most relevant documents
- Efficient document embedding and storage

### 3. Streaming Response Architecture
- Real-time response streaming using SSE
- Reduced initial response latency
- Improved user experience with progressive content delivery

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **AI/ML**: Azure OpenAI, Langchain
- **Vector Store**: Pinecone
- **Text-to-Speech**: Azure TTS

## üí° Problems Solved

### 1. Context Management
**Challenge**: Maintaining accurate context across document chunks
**Solution**: 
- Implemented overlapping chunks
- Custom prompt template for context preservation
- Metadata tracking for source documents

### 2. Response Latency
**Challenge**: High latency in traditional request-response model
**Solution**:
- Implemented SSE for streaming responses
- Optimized vector store queries
- Concurrent document processing

### 3. Scalability
**Challenge**: Handling large documents efficiently
**Solution**:
- Chunk-based processing
- Optimized vector embeddings
- Efficient document retrieval system

## üìà Performance Achievements

- **Query Response Time**: < 2 seconds for initial response
- **Document Processing**: Efficient handling of large text files
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized through chunking and streaming
